Lost and Found Mobile Application for Students
Our capstone project is a mobile application designed to help students easily report and find lost items on campus. The app allows users to post details and photos of items theyâ€™ve found or lost, making it simple for the rightful owners to search and identify their belongings. This system promotes honesty, saves time, and ensures that lost items are returned quickly and efficiently within the school community.
